# Excelent-2D-Platformer-Project
This project's objective is to implement the basic mechanics that any good 2D platformer should have, such as:
1. Jump buffer
2. Coyote time
3. Variable jump time
4. Ledge hop (pixel jump)
5. Look ahead camera: when moving in a certain direction, the camera will show more of the environment to that side.
6. Dust trail and fall particles

In terms of abilities, the goal is to implement the following basic ones:
1. Multiple jump
2. Dash
3. Wall jump
4. Wall grind

In terms of environment, the project will implement:
1. One way platforms: you can jump from below to the platform
2. Moving platforms: the player will move along the moving platform when on it
3. Fall from platform: press down to fall from the plaftorm
4. Score/Progress System: A system to track the player's score, progress through levels, remaining lives, etc. This also includes checkpoints or save game states

In terms Unity tools and editor/debug helpers, it will have:
1. FPS counter (checkbox)
2. Character trail renderer (checkbox)

In terms of UI, it will have the following windows:
Main menu with:
1. Play
2. Options
3. Credits
4. Exit

The Options window will have sliders to change:
1. General volume
2. Music volume
3. Sound effects volume
